Solution for hanoi tower problem using recursion

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves three rods and a number of disks of different sizes that can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks stacked in ascending order of size on one rod, with the smallest disk at the top and the largest at the bottom, forming a conical shape.

The objective of the game is to move the entire stack of disks to another rod, adhering to the following rules:

- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty rod.
- No disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk.
